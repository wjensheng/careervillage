# Career Village

## Data
Dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-careervillage/data

## Problem Statement
The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.

## Goal
My goal is to develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.

## Executive Summary
Create a meta-recommender system that accounts for timeliness, similarity of historical answers, reputation, and location of professionals while recommending a professional to a question asked by students on the platform.
